      <description>So during some downtime during paternity leave, I decided to really research where we should put my daughter’s car seat. After two hours of research and a small Monte Carlo simulation, this post is what I have to show for myself.
The key stat I found in my research is that putting the car seat in the middle can reduce the likelihood of fatality by 43% as compared to putting the car seat on the side [1].</description>

      <description>I wanted to make a plot of the sickness in our lives… and after three hours of Python I have this post to show for it. I clearly have problems (and better ways to spend my time).
In any case, the first graph here shows me and my wife’s health in 2013. Pretty regular adult health time series — on average about two illnesses a year that we quickly bounced back from.</description>
