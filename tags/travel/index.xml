      <description>We recently came back from a 2-week family trip to Australia. We wanted to go to three major places in Australia on our trip there. The usual choices are Sydney, the Red Centre, and the Great Barrier Reef. But we opted to cut out the Reef and go to Tasmania instead. Mainly because it just seemed so much cooler. After going there, I am happy to say weâ€™re so glad that we made that choice.</description>
