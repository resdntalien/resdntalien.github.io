      <description>We recently came back from a 2-week family trip to Australia. We wanted to go to three major places in Australia on our trip there. The usual choices are Sydney, the Red Centre, and the Great Barrier Reef. But we opted to cut out the Reef and go to Tasmania instead. Mainly because it just seemed so much cooler. After going there, I am happy to say we’re so glad that we made that choice.</description>

      <description>They are likely the best places you’ve never heard of. What are they? Ajanta and Ellora are two huge cave complexes carved out of the rock of the Deccan Plateau in India. They are both UNESCO world heritage sites filled with Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain temples, sculptures, and paintings that are over 2000 years old. As an archaeological site, they are up there with the Pyramids of Giza, Ankgor Wat, and the Roman Colosseum.</description>
