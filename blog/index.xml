      <title>Latex Equations in Hugo</title>

      <description>Goal I want to write Latex equations inline in my content markdown and have Hugo compile to equations that show up on my webpage.
Step by Step Solution Good news – this possible in Hugo. But it took me awhile to piece it all together, so I’m putting the solution here for others.
Add mathjax to HTML footer. We will do this by adding this snippet to layouts/partials/footer.html:  &amp;lt;scriptsrc=&amp;quot;https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; &amp;lt;scriptid=&amp;quot;MathJax-script&amp;quot;async src=&amp;quot;https://cdn.</description>

      <description>Here&#39;s a short list of some of the best books I read this year.
Exhalation Ted Chiang&#39;s second collection of short stories. Sone of the best sci-fi short stories I’ve read in a looong time. They will really get you thinking about AI, time travel, the nature of reality, and writing as a way of changing your thinking. This is the guy that wrote the short story that became the movie Arrival.</description>

      <description>I wanted to make a plot of the sickness in our lives… and after three hours of Python I have this post to show for it. I clearly have problems (and better ways to spend my time).
In any case, the first graph here shows me and my wife’s health in 2013. Pretty regular adult health time series — on average about two illnesses a year that we quickly bounced back from.</description>

      <description>Most classical statistical signal processing forecasting techniques — Weiner filtering, Kalman filtering, etc — minimize the MSE. The problem with the MSE is that it is very sensitive to scale. In many situations, we want a scale free error metric. By scale free, I mean a metric that can be used to compare the error for two different forecasts for two different series even if one typically has values between 0 and .</description>

      <title>Sample Mean Revisited</title>

      <description>I think statistics is taught wrong at most universities. It is taught as if computers were never invented. Now that was fine 100 years ago. Even 20 years ago. But now computation is dirt cheap — and there is a better way to learn statistics — through Monte Carlo simulation. For example, the sample mean is one of the first things you learn in a statistics class. You learn about the standard error of the sample mean and how it scales as \(\sigma/\sqrt{N}\).</description>
