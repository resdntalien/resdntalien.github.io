      <description>We did a short weekend trip to Mendocino over President&#39;s Day weekend this year. It&#39;s been on my radar for years to go to &amp;ndash; and we finally got the time this February. What follows is a short trip report about where to stay, what to do, and where to eat. Hopefully you find this useful.

      <title>Milky Way Astro Photography</title>

      <description>Seeing the Milky Way, especially the core of the galaxy, cutting across sky is a spiritual experience. It sucks that light pollution from civiliation has made it so that we can&#39;t see the night sky in its full glory usually. Most of the shots below were taken on trips to somewhere remote with super dark skies. Usually this is on top of a mountain somewhere or in the middle of the desert.</description>

      <title>Solar Eclipse Time Lapses</title>

      <description>I&#39;ve been obsessed with solar eclipses since I was a kid. I&#39;ve made a lo-fi rig by cutting up one of those Mylar solar eclipse glasses and taping it to the front of my telephoto SLR lens. It takes some test shots to get the exposure right, but once you do you can get a good shot of the solar disc being covered. Then I take a shot every few minutes and stitch it together in post.</description>

      <title>Latex Equations in Hugo</title>
      <link>https://resdntalien.github.io/blog/mathjax_hugo/</link>

      <guid>https://resdntalien.github.io/blog/mathjax_hugo/</guid>
      <description>Goal I want to write Latex equations inline in my content markdown and have Hugo compile to equations that show up on my webpage.
Step by Step Solution Good news – this possible in Hugo. But it took me awhile to piece it all together, so I’m putting the solution here for others.
Add mathjax to HTML footer. We will do this by adding this snippet to layouts/partials/footer.html:  &amp;lt;scriptsrc=&amp;quot;https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; &amp;lt;scriptid=&amp;quot;MathJax-script&amp;quot;async src=&amp;quot;https://cdn.</description>

      <description>Here&#39;s a short list of some of the best books I read this year.
Exhalation Ted Chiang&#39;s second collection of short stories. Sone of the best sci-fi short stories I’ve read in a looong time. They will really get you thinking about AI, time travel, the nature of reality, and writing as a way of changing your thinking. This is the guy that wrote the short story that became the movie Arrival.</description>

      <description>One of the clear themes in my photography is making humans seems small in comparison to the grandeur of Nature. One composition I keep coming back to is a human meditating on the spectacle unfolding before them. Here&#39;s a few of my favorites of that composition.

      <title>Tasmania Road Trip</title>

      <description>We recently came back from a 2-week family trip to Australia. We wanted to go to three major places in Australia on our trip there. The usual choices are Sydney, the Red Centre, and the Great Barrier Reef. But we opted to cut out the Reef and go to Tasmania instead. Mainly because it just seemed so much cooler. After going there, I am happy to say we’re so glad that we made that choice.</description>

      <description>They are likely the best places you’ve never heard of. What are they? Ajanta and Ellora are two huge cave complexes carved out of the rock of the Deccan Plateau in India. They are both UNESCO world heritage sites filled with Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain temples, sculptures, and paintings that are over 2000 years old. As an archaeological site, they are up there with the Pyramids of Giza, Ankgor Wat, and the Roman Colosseum.</description>

      <title>Carrizo Plain Super Bloom</title>

      <description>Original Medium Posting from 2017
Chances are if you’re reading this you’ve heard that Southern California is experiencing a “super bloom” this year. This is the first time we’ve gotten significant winter rains in almost a decade, and all the wildflowers are blowing up. Currently, there’s a place called Carrizo Plain National Monument that is “super-blooming”. I saw some pictures of it last week and I knew I had to go.</description>

      <title>Happy Birthday to the Ground</title>

      <description>My daughter just recently really discovered gravity. By discover, I mean that she understands that if she releases something from her high chair it will accelerate toward the ground at 9.8 m/s^2 until its hits the ground with a thud. A satisfying thud. At first, I was super impressed with her. She’d do experiments dropping everything from blocks to carrots to puffs cereal to see if they all had the same effect.</description>

      <title>Car Seat Placement Analysis</title>

      <description>So during some downtime during paternity leave, I decided to really research where we should put my daughter’s car seat. After two hours of research and a small Monte Carlo simulation, this post is what I have to show for myself.
The key stat I found in my research is that putting the car seat in the middle can reduce the likelihood of fatality by 43% as compared to putting the car seat on the side [1].</description>

      <description>I wanted to make a plot of the sickness in our lives… and after three hours of Python I have this post to show for it. I clearly have problems (and better ways to spend my time).
In any case, the first graph here shows me and my wife’s health in 2013. Pretty regular adult health time series — on average about two illnesses a year that we quickly bounced back from.</description>

      <description>Most classical statistical signal processing forecasting techniques — Weiner filtering, Kalman filtering, etc — minimize the MSE. The problem with the MSE is that it is very sensitive to scale. In many situations, we want a scale free error metric. By scale free, I mean a metric that can be used to compare the error for two different forecasts for two different series even if one typically has values between 0 and .</description>

      <title>Sample Mean Revisited</title>

      <description>I think statistics is taught wrong at most universities. It is taught as if computers were never invented. Now that was fine 100 years ago. Even 20 years ago. But now computation is dirt cheap — and there is a better way to learn statistics — through Monte Carlo simulation. For example, the sample mean is one of the first things you learn in a statistics class. You learn about the standard error of the sample mean and how it scales as \(\sigma/\sqrt{N}\).</description>
